### Motivation

I wrote this app mostly for learning purposes. I was looking at cool Kotlin frameworks and randomly stumbled upon this one and being an avid chess-fan (but far from good at it ðŸ˜…) I decided to try and make the game. Back when I started (and maybe also now) the documentation was very scarce and there was a lot of trial and error involved in getting the app to the point where it is now.

### Current state
- [x] Rendered board
- [x] Drag and drop of pieces (with snap-to-center functionality)
- [x] General game logic (internal board state etc.)
- [ ] Valid moves for pieces (including promotion, check, casteling)
- [ ] Previous state of the game (to see all previous positions)
- [ ] Sound
- [ ] Time (Classic, Rapid and Bullet)
- [ ] Final polishing

### Maybe
- Backend for online playing
- Different themes

### Out of scope
- A fully fledged game
- Chess engine
- Import/export positions
